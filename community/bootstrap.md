# Argo Bootstrap Committee

Inder to ensure an open and well-ordered growth of the Argo Community, we would like to formalize the governing structure and processes for the Argo Project. The Argo bootstrap committee has been tasked with soliciting feedback from the community and making proposals for the governance of the Argo Project. This PR serves to document and communicate the work of the bootstrap committee to the Argo Community. 

## Members

The bootstrap committee members have been selected based on past and expected future contributions to the Argo Community.

Members are:
* Ben Browning (Red Hat)
* Edward Lee (Intuit)
* Jesse Suen (Intuit)
* Lei Zhang (Alibaba)
* Mike Bowen (BlackRock)
* Mukulika Kapas (Intuit)
* Shoubhik Bose (Red Hat)

The bootstrap committee MUST:
* Represent a cross-section of interests, not just one company
* Balance technical, architectural, and governance expertise since its initial mission is the establishment of structure around contributions, community, and decision-making
* Communicate with the community on a regular cadence
